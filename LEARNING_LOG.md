# Project 1: Tic-Tac-Toe
- Setup grid with borders around every grid item to setup board
- Established positions $state to track position values in array 
- Created makeMove function to update positions values. 
- Created winningCombos, currentPlayer, and checkWinner functions and values to indicate who won. 
- Added shadcn-svelte dialog to display winner and give option of new game which resets postions.
- I have a lot to learn about JS functions. That was the part of this I was the least comfortable with.
