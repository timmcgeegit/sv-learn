# sv-learn Project

## Purpose
Personal learning project to build Svelte 5 proficiency through creating a family game library.
Focus on reducing AI dependency and building genuine coding skills.

## Primary Goals
- Master Svelte 5 runes and state management without AI assistance
- Build interactive games for kids (ages 6-7)
- Learn through hands-on building rather than theory
- Transition from Cursor IDE to Neovim proficiency
## Learning Context
- ADHD & Dyslexia considerations - prefer patterns over memorization
- Daily practice: 10-15 minute focused sessions
- Socratic method preferred - guide discovery, don't give direct answers
- "Productive struggle" - slightly challenging problems with hint system

## Current Skill Levels
- Strong: HTML/CSS, Tailwind, Svelte project structure
- Moderate: Svelte 5 runes, component props, Linux/terminal
- Weak: JavaScript/TypeScript, state management, writing functions from scratch
## Tech Stack
- Framework: Svelte 5 + SvelteKit 2
- Styling: Tailwind CSS 4
- Database: Drizzle ORM + Postgres.js
- Authentication: Better Auth (future)
- Deployment: TBD (PWA capabilities required)
## Learning Progression
### Phase 1 (Current): Single Player, Local State
- Starting with: Tic Tac Toe
- Learning: Basic $state, event handling, component composition

### Daily Practice Structure
1. Vim motions practice (5 min)
2. Code one small feature (10 min)
3. Test and debug without AI

## Active Challenges
- Understanding where Svelte ends and TypeScript begins
- Writing state management logic independently
- Memorizing common JavaScript/DOM methods
## Development Guidelines
- Build from scratch with guidance, not copying
- Test with real users (family/kids)
- Focus on working features over perfect code
- Commit after each small working feature

## Game Development Priorities
1. Tic Tac Toe - Basic state management
2. Snake - Game loops and collision detection
3. Memory Match - Timers and animations
4. Connect 4 - Complex win conditions
