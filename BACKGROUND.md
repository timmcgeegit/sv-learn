## Learning Characteristics

### Learning Style Preferences

- **Hands-on Building**: Prefers building from scratch with guidance over studying theory
- **Challenge-Based**: Enjoys specific problems to solve, appreciates “productive struggle”
- **Socratic Method**: Wants guided discovery rather than direct answers
- **Project-Based**: Learns best through real applications with genuine value

### Neurodivergent Considerations

- **ADHD**: Benefits from multiple engagement points, flexible structure, variety
- **Dyslexia**: Finds coding challenging, struggles with memorizing syntax (similar to foreign languages)
- **Memory**: Prefers understanding patterns and relationships over rote memorization

### Engagement Patterns

- **Daily Practice**: Prefers 10-15 minute focused drills (5 days/week)
- **Project Sessions**: 1+ hour sessions when time and energy allow
- **Difficulty Preference**: Wants “slightly challenging” with hint system rather than too easy or too hard
- **Feedback**: Appreciates immediate feedback and real-world application testing

## Current Projects & Interests

### Active Work Projects

- **Rich Text Editor**: Building with TipTap fork specifically for Svelte, integrated with Shadcn/UI components
- **Salesforce Integration**: Building web apps that connect to company’s Salesforce CRM via API
- **Form Builders**: Interest in creating dynamic form generation tools

### Personal Project Ideas

- **Family Game Library**: Interactive games for kids (ages 6-7) - tic-tac-toe, memory games, etc.
- **Golf App**: Mobile-first PWA with offline capabilities, local storage, state sync
- **Budgeting App**: Offline-first PWA with cloud sync for sharing with spouse
- **Branded Presentation Generator**: Tool for creating brand-consistent presentations
- **Client Website Work**: Side projects involving typical web development challenges

### Technical Learning Goals

- **State Management**: Both local component state and cross-component data flow
- **Interactive UX**: Animations, transitions, drag-and-drop, high-quality user experiences
- **Offline-First Apps**: PWA development, local storage, background sync
- **Data Visualization**: Interest in D3.js integration and data manipulation
- **Database Integration**: Better understanding of Drizzle, APIs, and data persistence

## Learning Context & Constraints

### Time Management

- **Work Hours**: Uses AI tools in Cursor for efficiency and speed
- **Practice Time**: Flexible 10-15 minute sessions + weekend project time
- **Energy Levels**: Variable due to ADHD, prefers adaptable structure

### Knowledge Gaps

- **JavaScript Fundamentals**: Limited understanding of built-in browser APIs and DOM manipulation
- **TypeScript Boundaries**: Unclear where Svelte ends and TypeScript begins
- **Vim Motions**: No prior experience with modal editing or keyboard-centric workflows
- **Database Concepts**: Uses tools but doesn’t fully understand underlying patterns

### Success Indicators Desired

- **Independence**: Ability to write Svelte 5 components without AI assistance
- **Efficiency**: Comfortable navigation and editing in Neovim
- **Understanding**: Grasp of state management patterns and data flow
- **Application**: Building complete, working applications independently
- **Teaching**: Eventually able to explain concepts to others

## Motivation & Philosophy

- **Personal Growth**: Learning for personal well-being and professional confidence
- **Real Value**: Wants to build applications that solve actual problems
- **Family Integration**: Kids as built-in testers for game projects
- **Future Vision**: Transition from AI-dependent to AI-augmented development
- **Practical Focus**: Prefers learning through building useful tools over academic exercises
